<h1> Hobbies </h1>
I have many different things that I enjoy doing. 

<ul>
    <li>Learning new skills</li>
    <li>Participating in community events</li>
    <li>Exploring new areas, especially in the outdoors</li>
    <li>Table-top roleplay games</li>
    <li>Cooking and eating food!</li>
</ul>

I am also an animal enthusiast! I have two dogs, two cats, a bird, a snake, and a myriad of rehabilitating creatures in my care at any given time.
